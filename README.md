# CTD-prework

Hello and welcome to a very brief Star Wars database. It features 6 Star Wars Film information pages, and 9 Star Wars character infomation pages. There is a home page, and a master list page for both characters and films. Information is retrived from SWAPI- a Star Wars API.

# Instruction

1. I used the API tool, AXIOS, which I installed via link in the head in the HTML pages that required an API call.
2. Instead of creating separate JS files for each page, I included the JS using script in the necessary pages.
3. I used one CSS page and linked it to all of the pages in the head. I used classes to target the specific elements like the home page (index.html), and followed a standard format for the rest.
